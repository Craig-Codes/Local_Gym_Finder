# Local_Gym_Finder
JavaScript Web App utilising the Bing Maps API

I created this webapp to practice basic HTML / CSS skills (I use Adobe Animate of UI at work so it's good to use something different in personnal practice projects!). I also wanted to try out interacting with an API.

I used the Bing Maps API as Google now require credit card information to use their map API. Unfortunately the Navteq Point of Interest flags will not be supported after 2020, so this app, whilst only for practice, may well become out dated and give false information as soon as next year.

The aim of the app was to create an easy way for someone (In the EU... US data isn't supported in this app) to locate their nearest gym's, and gain some basic information about them.
